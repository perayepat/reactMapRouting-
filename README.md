Built with react 
## Basic commands such as :
### Npm start and crtl + C to run and stop the app in your command line 

**What I learnt from creating this app**
- Dynamically adjust variables as the react app is running 
- how to configure variables to the right format 

**My challanges**
- Getting the right methods from the documentation to work
- Css styling wasnt as resposnive so i had to use the tom tom api css 
- the map refreshes but turns white now and then
